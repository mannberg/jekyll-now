I've been a full-time iOS developer since 2013. Swift ticks all my boxes - it's a compiled, statically typed language with an extremely elegant api that makes you feel more like you're using Ruby than something like Java.

As much as I love doing iOS stuff, I consider the greatness of Swift to be mainly in the language itself, rather than the Apple frameworks it's often used with. Because of that, I'm super-excited about what the future might hold for Swift in other areas such as systems and server-side programming.
